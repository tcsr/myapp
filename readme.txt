1. Business Layer
Business Objectives:
Enable farmers to register farms and themselves easily.
Provide accurate mapping of farm boundaries using polygon mapping.
Maintain a centralized system to track farmer and farm information.
Key Business Processes:
Farmer Registration: Capturing farmer details such as name, contact information, identification, and bank account details.
Farm Registration: Allowing farmers to register their farms, including farm name, location, size, type of crops grown, and farm activities.
Polygon Mapping: Allowing farmers to map the boundaries of their farms using GPS coordinates, ensuring accurate representation.
Business Capabilities:
Farmer Onboarding: Ability to register and verify farmer information.
Farm Data Management: Managing farm details and their attributes.
Geospatial Mapping: Accurate mapping and visualization of farm boundaries using polygon mapping.
Data Analytics & Reporting: Providing insights into farm sizes, locations, and crop types.
Business Outputs:
Business Process Flowcharts for farm and farmer registration
Capability models showing registration, data management, and analytics processes
2. Data Layer
Data Entities:
Farmer: Represents farmer details (ID, Name, Contact Info, Identification, Address, Bank Details).
Farm: Represents farm attributes (Farm ID, Farmer ID, Name, Location, Crop Types, Size).
Polygon: Stores geospatial data (Polygon ID, Farm ID, Latitude, Longitude, GPS Coordinates, Boundaries).
Registration: Tracks registration details (Registration ID, Farmer ID, Farm ID, Date, Status).
Data Relationships:
One-to-Many relationship between Farmer and Farm (a farmer can own multiple farms).
One-to-One relationship between Farm and Polygon (each farm has one polygon mapping).
Data Governance:
Data Quality: Ensure valid and complete data during registration.
Data Security: Implement access controls to protect farmer and farm information.
Data Ownership: Farmers are the owners of their data, with read-only access granted to administrators.
Data Models:
Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) showing relationships between Farmer, Farm, and Polygon entities.
Logical Data Models defining the structure and attributes of each entity.
Outputs:
Data Dictionary
Logical and Physical Data Models
3. Application Layer
Core Applications:
Farmer Registration Module: Allows farmers to register and manage their profiles.
Farm Management Module: Provides functionality for farmers to register and manage farm details.
Polygon Mapping Module: Enables farmers to draw and edit polygon boundaries for their farms using an interactive map.
Admin Dashboard: A dashboard for administrators to manage and monitor all farmer and farm registrations.
Integration Points:
Geospatial API Integration: Integrate with mapping APIs like Google Maps or OpenLayers for polygon mapping.
Payment Gateway: Integration with payment services for any registration fees or transactions.
Notification Services: Integration with SMS/Email services to confirm registrations and updates.
Application Services:
Authentication & Authorization: Secure login for farmers and administrators.
Validation Service: Validating farmer and farm data during registration.
Polygon Mapping Service: Handling geospatial data and converting it to a format compatible with the data model.
Outputs:
Application Architecture Diagrams showing how modules interact.
Service Catalog defining available services (e.g., registration, mapping, notifications).
4. Technology Layer
Infrastructure:
Web Application Framework: Angular/React for the front-end application.
Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js or a Java Spring Boot for handling server-side logic.
Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for storing spatial data (polygons), or MongoDB with GeoJSON support.
Geospatial Mapping: Integration with Leaflet or Google Maps API for polygon drawing and mapping.
Cloud Platform: AWS/Azure/GCP for hosting, with services like S3 for storing farm images/documents.
Technology Stack:
Front-End: Angular/React for creating responsive user interfaces.
Back-End: Node.js/Express or Java Spring Boot for API handling and business logic.
Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data or MongoDB with GeoJSON for NoSQL needs.
Integration Services: REST APIs for communication between front-end and back-end.
Security: OAuth2 / Keycloak for authentication, SSL for data encryption, and role-based access control (RBAC).
DevOps Practices:
CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins/GitHub Actions for automated deployments.
Docker for containerization.
Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.
Outputs:
Technology Architecture Diagrams
Infrastructure Blueprints

BDAT Architecture Blueprint Summary
Business Layer:
Supports the end-to-end process of farmer and farm registration with polygon mapping.
Data Layer:
Well-defined entities for Farmer, Farm, and Polygon with relationships.
Application Layer:
Modules handling specific business functions (registration, mapping, and admin).
Technology Layer:
Uses a combination of cloud services, geospatial tools, and scalable frameworks.
Tools for Visualization and Documentation
Lucidchart / Microsoft Visio: For creating BDAT architecture diagrams.
Erwin Data Modeler / dbdiagram.io: For data modeling.
Draw.io: For simple diagram creation and architecture visualization.
AWS Architecture Icons / Azure Architecture Icons: For cloud-specific diagrams.
This architecture should provide a comprehensive foundation for the farm registration, farmer registration, and polygon mapping system, aligning business needs with technical solutions.
