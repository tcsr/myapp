Objective:
Integrate data from OFIS and DSE to create a unified system that manages sustainability-related details (Farmer, Farm, and Polygon) and procurement details for Olam Agri.

Key Data Sources:
OFIS (Olam Farmer Information System)

Provides Farmer details (Name, ID, Location)
Provides Farm details (Farm Size, Crop Type, Location)
Provides Polygon Mapping for accurate farm boundary representation.
DSE (Digital Supply Engine)

Provides Procurement Details (Purchase orders, delivery schedules, product quantities, pricing, etc.)
Data Categories:
Sustainability:

Farmer Details: Data related to farmer identity and profiles.
Farm Details: Data related to farm locations, crops, and management.
Polygon Mapping: Spatial data for farm boundary visualization.
Procurement:

Purchase Orders: Details of transactions made for crop purchases.
Delivery and Supply: Information on delivery schedules, quantities, and quality checks.
Approach for Integration:
1. Data Extraction:
Extract Farmer, Farm, and Polygon data from OFIS.
Extract Procurement data from DSE.
2. Data Transformation:
Convert the data into a unified format to maintain consistency (standardizing field names, data types, and structures).
3. Data Loading:
Store sustainability data in a Sustainability Data Store.
Store procurement data in a Procurement Data Store.
4. Data Integration:
Create relationships between farmers, farms, polygons, and procurement data using unique identifiers (e.g., Farmer ID, Farm ID).
Diagram Outline
Entities:
OFIS: Supplies data for Farmers, Farms, and Polygons.
DSE: Supplies Procurement details.
Processes:
Data Extraction from OFIS: Collects farmer, farm, and polygon data.
Data Extraction from DSE: Collects procurement data.
Data Transformation: Standardizes and converts data into a unified format.
Data Loading: Stores data in respective data stores (Sustainability and Procurement).
Data Integration: Links sustainability data with procurement data for comprehensive analysis.
I will now create a simple diagram representing how data flows from OFIS and DSE into the integrated system for Sustainability and Procurement.
